# 4xTube

Features:
•	Adjust the speed of youtube videos to any speed you desire (0.5- 4x with sound, hence the name)
•	Full access to mobile version of YouTube

A comfortable rate of speech for listening is about 150 words per minute, which is the speed of most audiobooks and lectures. However, research suggests that we are very capable of listening with full comprehension at a rate of speech in excess of  300 words per minute.
Youtubes current app does not allow you to change the playback speed by default. In fact only the desktop web version allows upto 2x playback. 
This is not a technical limitation. HTML5 allows for user definable playback speeds. This YouTube application exposes these controls
Personally I like 3.6x if using headphones 2.5 without.

Thank you for looking
